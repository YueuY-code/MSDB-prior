# MSDB-prior
  Multi-source dynamic borrowing Bayesian (MSDB) prior is a new Bayesian information borrowing method that allows for the incorporation of multiple historical datasets with varying degrees of heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing baseline imbalances and effect heterogeneity.
  The flexibility of the MSDB prior framework makes it applicable to a wide range of scenarios, such as bridging trials for new regional drug applications, multi-regional clinical trials in the context of global collaborative research and development, and pediatric trials involving extrapolation from adults to pediatric populations. Additionally, with regulatory agencies like the FDA and NMPA placing greater emphasis on the use of real-world data for pharmaceutical research (Jarow and others 2017), the MSDB prior framework holds significant potential in applications.
